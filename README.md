# Inventory_management

- [ ] Tracking receiving and forwarding company's equipments history (ex. laptops , monitors .. )

While I was working at a startup, there's no system for managing company's equipments inventory.   
All the managements were made by hand so that it could not be tracked or managed efficiently.
